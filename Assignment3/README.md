####
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. Rules may permit or forbid proper nouns, such as names, places, brands, or slang. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark.
## Is Armstrong Number :
#### 
The Armstrong number is called a number. If we multiply each of its numbers by the power of the number of numbers, it becomes equal to the number itself.
Example :
Consider the number 153
153 is a three-digit number, so we multiply each of its numbers by the power of three and add it together:
153 = 1 * 1 * 1 + 5 * 5 * 5 + 3 * 3 * 3
The number 153 is an Armstrong number.

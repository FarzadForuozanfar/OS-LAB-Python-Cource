If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark.
### Is Armstrong Number :
#### 
The Armstrong number is called a number. If we multiply each of its numbers by the power of the number of numbers, it becomes equal to the number itself.
#### Example :
#### 
Consider the number 153
153 is a three-digit number, so we multiply each of its numbers by the power of three and add it together:
153 = 1 * 1 * 1 + 5 * 5 * 5 + 3 * 3 * 3
The number 153 is an Armstrong number.
